              Roll to Help brings together the tabletop gaming community to support meaningful causes. We believe in the power of play to create positive change, connecting gamers who want to make a difference through the hobby they love.

              Our current focus is supporting "Choose to Help," a vital organization that has been providing essential aid to Ukrainian refugees in Georgia. As they prepare to close their operations, our gaming community is rallying to help them one last time.

              Our system is simple: experienced Game Masters volunteer to run tabletop roleplaying games, and players bid for seats at these tables. The highest bidders win spots in the games, with all proceeds going directly to our supported charity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              To participate, browse the available games, find one that interests you, and place a bid using your Telegram username. If you're among the highest bidders when the auction closes, you'll receive a confirmation message with details about the event location, what to bring, and how to complete your payment.
